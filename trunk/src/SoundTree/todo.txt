- have a playSequential or somehting function for group

- have a play next in group

- pre-cache option?

- events

- get rid of public to private map and just set variables with _ t thebeginning



direct query...have to go through the tree manully every time a property is requested (example center of mass in qb2Group, playing in stSoundGroup)

incremental properties...these increment/decrement based on child nodes flushing their changes up the tree (mass in qb2Tangible, numInstances/numBytes/length in stSoundObject)

inherit properties...properties that are set either explicitly by the user (and propograted down the tree if so), or implictly set by virtue of an object being added to a container that has some property(ies) explicitly set, or has an ancestor who getssome property explicitly set and therefore it is cascadaded down

the above can be broken down further into properties that make immediate active changes to an object(s) in the tree, and therefore need a setPropertyImplicitly type of function, and passive properties that just describe state or are only needed when calling a method of an object to do something
